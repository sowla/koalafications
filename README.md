# Hi!

Thanks for stopping by! I'm a biologist who's curious about data analysis :) I don't have formal data science/programming qualifications, but I do enjoy exploring different packages and practicing old skills as well as learning new ones. I love the idea of learning out loud, so that's what I'm planning to do here!
